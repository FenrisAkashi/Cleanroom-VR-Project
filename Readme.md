This was a senior year group project, we were a team of 6. I was mostly working on creating the 3D models and finding the materials to use on them inside of Unreal. I helped create the final polished look of the cleanroom.

To run you must open the .uproject file from inside Unreal Engine. In order to play the module you must have the Oculus Quest 2 VR headset. See Documentation file.

The "My 3D models" folder contains both the blender and fbx files of the assets I created. The 3D models were created in blender, then exported as fbx files which were then imported into unreal.

The screenshots folder contains screenshots of the models inside Unreal with materials applied and some gifs showing the objects in motion. A couple are straight from blender without material applied.

Unable to upload Content/StarterContent/HDRI/HDRI_Epic_Courtyard_Daylight.uasset, this file by itself was over 25mb which is the limit on git. It does not seem to cause any issues when the project is opened in Unreal, however I do not own a VR headset to test it on.
